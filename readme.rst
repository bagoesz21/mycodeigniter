What is CodeIgniter
###################

This is my default project codeigniter with custom code, plugins and libraries 
to improve build web site.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
